      <p>This tool visualises the dynamics of the entry level job market for medium-skilled occupations.</p>
      <p>For each medium skilled occupation, users can explore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the level of demand</li>
        <li>salaries offered by employers</li>
        <li>the level of competition job seekers face</li>
        <li>locations with the strongest job prospects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The findings can be shown at UK-wide, nation or regional level, along with specific Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) areas associated with the city regions.

      <h2 id="how-to">Understanding the charts</h2>

      <h4>Exploring all occupations within a location</h4>
      <p>
        On the main view from the homepage, the two charts included in the tool are best viewed in combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bar chart shows the raw number of advertised job openings, broken out by education level (Higher Education, Further Education, or School Leaver).
      </p>
      <p>
        The scatter plot shows salary and opportunity (a figure that combines number of posted openings and number of job seekers). The oppportunity score ranges from 1 to 100 - a high score means that it's easier to get a job (there are few job seekers relative to job openings), while a lower score means that job seekers face higher competition.
      </p>

      <h4>Exploring all locations for a given occupation</h4>

      <p>
        To explore prospects across the UK for a given occupation, select an occupation from the homepage and then launch the data table.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the occupation table, you can browse job concentration and job prospects (openings, salary, employment opportunity) across locations. Job concentration can also be visualized in a map.
      </p>


      <h2 id="occupations">What occupations are included?</h2>
      <p>
        The tool shows information on medium-skilled occupations (defined by <a href='http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/index.html' target='_blank'>Standard Occupational Classification</a> code) including: 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Associate Professional and Technical</li>
        <li>Administrative and Secretarial</li>
        <li>Skilled Trades</li>
        <li>Caring</li>
        <li>Leisure and Other Service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All data are from 2014, the most recent year for which both job-posting and educational data are available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Medium-skilled are typically those occupations which offer robust salaries, but which do not require a higher education credential.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purposes of this tool, higher education graduates with an appropriate degree are included in the calculations of job seekers. This is based on actual destination data of graduates as shown in the Labour Force Survey. Employers recruiting for these occupations frequently request degree level or equivalent qualifications, and similarly graduates are not prohibited from applying for medium-skilled roles.
      </p>

      <h2 id="who">Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        This tool is for learning providers, employers and job seekers of medium-skilled jobs. This tool intends to help stakeholders align educational credentials to current employer demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information can be used to guide the development of new training programmes and to help support job seekers to select which training programmes offer the strongest job opportunities in their local area.
