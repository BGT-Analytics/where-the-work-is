        <a href='http://burning-glass.com/' target='_blank'>Burning Glass</a> and the <a href='http://www.ippr.org/' target='_blank'>Institute for Public Policy Research</a> (IPPR) have developed <strong>Where the work is</strong> to compare entry-level employer demand and the number of learners completing related programmes of study.
      </p>
      <p>
        This alignment can be examined by occupation group for Higher Education (HE) or Further Education (FE) programmes. The <a href="/methodology.html">methodology</a> used in developing this tool allows for the most detailed measure possible of employer demand, along with data from FE and HE learner figures as an estimate of supply.

        This tool is part of the JPMorgan Chase <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/new-skills-at-work.htm" target="_blank">New Skills at Work</a> programme.
      </p>

      <p>
        The programme aims to identify strategies and support solutions that help improve labour market infrastructure and develop the skilled workforce globally. The initiative brings together leading policymakers, academics, business leaders, educators, training providers and nonprofits with the goal of connecting labour market policy with practice, supply with demand and employers with the workforce – all to strengthen the global economy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 2014, the <a href='http://ippr.org' target="_blank">Institute for Public Policy Research</a> (IPPR) has been working as a key partner of the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/new-skills-europe-video" target="_blank">New Skills at Work in Europe</a> programme. Europe needs more jobs and better jobs; it also needs education and skills training that matches people from every background to the opportunities opened up by business growth and technological change. Through high-profile events and in-depth research reports on connecting labour market policy with practice and supply with demand, we are helping to improve labour market infrastructure and develop a skilled workforce. The IPPR website offers <a href="http://www.ippr.org/major-programmes/new-skills-at-work" target="_blank">a more detailed overview</a> of IPPR’s work as part of this programme.
