      <p>The two charts included in the tool are best viewed in combination. The bar chart at the right, Which Occupations Have the Most Openings, shows the raw number of advertised job openings, broken out by education level requested (Higher Education, Further Education, or School Leaver).</p> 

      <p>The scatter plot at the left, Which Occupations are Most Promising, combines posted openings, supply of workers, and salary information. Each listing includes an Opportunity Rating on a scale of 1 to 100. The higher the rating, the more opportunity there is in that occupation.</p>

      <p>The View Job Concentration option allows you to view job postings in a specific occupation by Nations and Regions and by LEP. The higher the concentration, the more openings are available in that region or LEP.</p>
