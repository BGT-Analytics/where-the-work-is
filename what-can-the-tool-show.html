      <p>The interactive tool enables users to explore demand for particular medium-skill roles, the potential salary benefits, and the likely levels of competition for these positions, based on the numbers of other programme finishers. The findings can be shown at UK-wide, nation, or regional level, along with specific Local Enterprise Partnership areas associated with the city regions.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to">How to use this tool</h2>

      <h4>Exploring all occupations within a location</h4>
      <p>
        From the homepage, the main view allows you to explore occupational prospects by location. On the main view, the two charts are best viewed in combination.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar chart shows the raw number of advertised job openings, broken out by education level (Higher Education, Further Education, or School Leaver).
      </p>

      <p>
        The scatter plot shows salary and opportunity (a figure that combines number of posted openings and number of job seekers). The oppportunity score ranges from 1 to 100 - a high score means that it's easier to get a job (there are few job seekers relative to job openings), while a lower score means that job seekers face higher competition.
      </p>

      <h4>Exploring all locations for a given occupation</h4>

      <p>
        To explore prospects across the UK for a given occupation, select an occupation from the homepage and then launch the data table.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the occupation table, you can browse job concentration and job prospects (openings, salary, employment opportunity) across locations. Job concentration can also be visualized in a map.
      </p>

      <h2 id="occupations">Occupations included</h2>

      <p>The tool shows information on medium-skilled jobs (defined by Standard Occupational Classification code) including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Associate Professional and Technical</li>
        <li>Administrative and Secretarial</li>
        <li>Skilled Trades</li>
        <li>Caring</li>
        <li>Leisure and Other Service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All data are from 2014, the most recent year for which both job-posting and educational data are available.</p>

      <p>Medium-skilled jobs are usually defined as those not requiring a bachelor’s degree or equivalent level qualification. For the purposes of this tool, however, Higher Education graduates with an appropriate degree are included in the calculations of job seekers. This is based on actual destination data of graduates as shown in the Labour Force Survey. Employers recruiting for these occupations frequently request degree level or equivalent qualifications, and similarly graduates are not prohibited from applying for medium-skilled roles.</p>

      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to note that this tool only focuses on medium-skilled occupations. This means that occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher are excluded. Occupations that do not require any formal qualifications or training are also excluded from this tool, since the number of job seekers cannot be meaningfully quantified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some occupations do not have specific qualifications or subject-specific requirements (such as Sales, Marketing and Related Associate Professionals). As a result of this, and despite the fact that many people with a broad range of qualifications can apply for these occupations, they frequently appear “under supplied” in the tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some occupations do not rely solely on college finishers or graduates from their immediate location. Many people travel to find work, often moving across the country. Other occupations, such as those on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee" target="_blank">Migration Advisory Committee</a> (MAC) shortage occupation list, may rely more heavily on workforce arriving from outside the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burning Glass acknowledge that not all jobs are posted online, although a comparison of the <a href='http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/index.html' target='_blank'>Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings</a> (ASHE) Employment Data and Burning Glass Technologies postings data for UK in 2014 showed a 94% correlation between their occupational distributions. The posting data slightly over-estimate the proportion of professional and associate professional occupations, while slightly under-estimating the proportion of elementary occupations. Note that Professional and elementary occupations are not included in the scope of this tool.
