      <p>The interactive tool enables users to explore demand for particular medium-skill roles, the potential salary benefits, and the likely levels of competition for these positions, based on the numbers of other programme finishers. The findings can be shown at UK-wide, nation, or regional level, along with specific Local Enterprise Partnership areas associated with the city regions.</p>

      <h4>What occupations are included?</h4>

      <p>The tool shows information on medium-skilled jobs (defined by Standard Occupational Classification code) including Associate Professional and Technical occupations, Administrative and Secretarial occupations, Skilled Trades occupations, and Caring, Leisure and Other Service occupations. All data are from 2014, the most recent year for which both job-posting and educational data are available.</p>

      <p>Medium-skilled jobs are usually defined as those not requiring a bachelor’s degree or equivalent level qualification. For the purposes of this tool, however, Higher Education graduates with an appropriate degree are included in the calculations of “supply”. This is based on actual destination data of graduates as shown in the Labour Force Survey. Employers recruiting for these occupations frequently request degree level or equivalent qualifications, and similarly graduates are not prohibited from applying for medium-skilled roles.</p>

      <p>The tool does not cover positions that are not considered medium skill, or those that do not have formal qualifications or training. For more details on what the tool can and cannot display, please see the limitations section of the methodology.</p>
