      <p>The interactive tool enables users to explore demand for particular medium-skill roles, the potential salary benefits, and the likely levels of competition for these positions, based on the numbers of other programme finishers. The findings can be shown at UK-wide, nation, or regional level, along with specific Local Enterprise Partnership areas associated with the city regions.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to">How to use this tool</h2>

      <h4>Exploring all occupations within a location</h4>
      <p>
        From the homepage, the main view allows you to explore occupational prospects by location. On the main view, the two charts are best viewed in combination.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bar chart shows the raw number of advertised job openings, broken out by education level (Higher Education, Further Education, or School Leaver).
      </p>

      <p>
        The scatter plot shows salary and opportunity (a figure that combines number of posted openings and number of job seekers). The oppportunity score ranges from 1 to 100 - a high score means that it's easier to get a job (there are few job seekers relative to job openings), while a lower score means that job seekers face higher competition.
      </p>

      <h4>Exploring all locations for a given occupation</h4>

      <p>
        To explore prospects across the UK for a given occupation, select an occupation from the homepage and then launch the data table.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the occupation table, you can browse job concentration and job prospects (openings, salary, employment opportunity) across locations. Job concentration can also be visualized in a map.
      </p>

      <h2 id="occupations">Occupations included</h2>

      <p>The tool shows information on medium-skilled jobs (defined by Standard Occupational Classification code) including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Associate Professional and Technical</li>
        <li>Administrative and Secretarial</li>
        <li>Skilled Trades</li>
        <li>Caring</li>
        <li>Leisure and Other Service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All data are from 2014, the most recent year for which both job-posting and educational data are available.</p>

      <p>Medium-skilled jobs are usually defined as those not requiring a bachelorâ€™s degree or equivalent level qualification. For the purposes of this tool, however, Higher Education graduates with an appropriate degree are included in the calculations of job seekers. This is based on actual destination data of graduates as shown in the Labour Force Survey. Employers recruiting for these occupations frequently request degree level or equivalent qualifications, and similarly graduates are not prohibited from applying for medium-skilled roles.</p>

      <p>The tool does not cover positions that are not considered medium skill, or those that do not have formal qualifications or training.</p>
