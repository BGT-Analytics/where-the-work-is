      <h1>What can this tool show?</h1>
      
      <p>
        This interactive tool enables users to explore demand for particular mid-skill roles and the potential salary benefits and likely levels of competition for these positions. The findings can be shown at UK-wide, national and regional levels, and within selected local enterprise partnership areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important considerations as you use the tool:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tool focuses on middle-skill roles (see <a href='#limitations'>limitations</a>).</li>
        <li>The tool focuses on entry-level jobs, defined by those postings in which the employer asks for less than two years’ experience, and on new entrants to the labour market.</li>
        <li>This labour market information is targeted at employers, training and education providers, and local and national decision-makers. Individuals who are seeking career guidance are welcome to make use of the tool, but since it is not intended to be a source of comprehensive advice and guidance to individual jobseekers, we would urge them to seek out other advice and guidance in addition to this tool.</li>
        <li>The tool does not take migration, either internal or international, into account. Therefore any significant inward or outward flows of education finishers within regions or LEP areas will not be reflected in the competitiveness levels shown in this tool.</li>
        <li>The data that underlies this tool can be downloaded as a spreadsheet (see <a href="/methodology.html">methodology</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="explore-by-location">Exploring all occupations within a location</h2>

      <p>
        From the homepage, you can explore occupational prospects by location. The two categories on the main view are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Job openings:</strong> The bar chart shows the number of advertised job openings for each middle-skill occupation, broken down by education level (higher education, further education, or school-leaver) required for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Employment opportunity:</strong> The scatterplot shows the average salary and level of opportunity (a figure that combines number of posted openings and number of jobseekers) for each middle-skill occupation. The opportunity score ranges from 1 to 100; a high score means there are few jobseekers relative to the number of job openings, and therefore that positions are less competitive, while a lower score means that jobseekers face greater competition for open positions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These charts are best viewed in combination.
      </p>

      <h2 id="explore-by-occupation">Exploring a given occupation</h2>

      <p>
        To explore prospects across the UK for a given occupation, select an occupation from the bar chart. This brings up a data panel on the top left and an option to compare data for this occupation across locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the occupation table, you can browse job concentration and job prospects (openings, salary, employment opportunity) across locations. Job concentration can also be visualised in a map.
      </p>

      <h2 id="occupations">Occupations included</h2>

      <p>
        The tool shows information on mid-skilled jobs, as defined by the Office for National Statistics’ standard occupational classification codes. These include roles in the following major occupation groups:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>associate professional and technical</li>
        <li>administrative and secretarial</li>
        <li>skilled trades</li>
        <li>caring</li>
        <li>leisure and other service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All data are from 2014, the most recent year for which both job-posting and educational data are available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mid-skilled jobs are usually defined as those that do not require a bachelor’s degree or equivalent-level qualification, but require some postsecondary education or on-the-job training. This makes these jobs ideal for further education finishers. For the purposes of this tool, higher education graduates with an appropriate degree are included in the calculations of jobseekers for those occupations in which they compete with further education finishers. This is based on actual destination data of graduates as shown in the Labour Force Survey. Employers recruiting for these occupations frequently request degree-level or equivalent qualifications, and similarly graduates are not prohibited from applying for mid-skilled roles.
      </p>

      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        Though this tool provides the most comprehensive and detailed free-to-use dashboard of supply and demand in the UK, the following limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the data.
      </p>

      <h4>Mid-skill roles</h4>
      <p>
        It is important to note that this tool only focuses on mid-skilled occupations. This means that occupations that require a bachelor’s degree or higher are excluded. Occupations that do not require any formal qualifications or training are also excluded from this tool, since the number of job-seekers cannot be meaningfully quantified.
      </p>

      <h4>Matching supply and demand</h4>
      <p>
        Some occupations do not have specific qualifications or subject-specific requirements (such as sales, marketing and related associate professionals). As a result of this, and despite the fact that many people with a broad range of qualifications can apply for these occupations, they frequently appear ‘undersupplied’ in the tool, i.e. when the “job opportunity” is low.
      </p>

      <h4>Internal and international migration</h4>
      <p>
        Some occupations do not rely solely on FE finishers or HE graduates from their immediate location. Many people travel to find work, often moving across the country. Other occupations, such as those on the Migration Advisory Committee’s shortage occupation list, may rely more heavily on jobseekers arriving from outside the UK.
      </p>

      <h4>Online and offline postings</h4>
      <p>
        Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) acknowledge that not all jobs are posted online, although a comparison of the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) employment data and BGT postings data for UK in 2014 showed a 94 per cent correlation between ASHE and BGT occupational distributions. The BGT posting data slightly overestimate the proportion of professional and associate professional occupations, while slightly underestimating the proportion of elementary occupations.
